# To Make It Do More Things You Want

This is not an up-goer art! Brought to you by _O'Really? Press_.


Every job is done within ```TBASEXTN.lua```. If you don't have one, make new one, and enter these lines and save:


    -- TBASIC extension
    
    -- these are utilities. Do not delete these lines
    local __assert        = _TBASIC.__assert
    local __assertlhand   = _TBASIC.__assertlhand
    local __assertrhand   = _TBASIC.__assertrhand
    local __checknumber   = _TBASIC.__checknumber
    local __checkstring   = _TBASIC.__checkstring
    local __readvar       = _TBASIC.__readvar
    local __resolvevararg = _TBASIC.__resolvevararg
    -- end of utilities


## Usual things that people should follow

To check if it's a number, you use ```__checknumber```. To check if it's letters, you use ```__checkstring```. To check the type you'll get, you use ```__assert```.

When it comes to name your *word*s that explains orders to the computer, their name starts with ```_fn```, if it's about *mark*s, their name starts with ```_op```.

<<if you want use function arguments or variables, they must be resolved using ```__readvar```>>

<<``__resolvevararg``>>

## To make it understand your new sets of words

You will be dealing with something called ```_TBASIC._FNCTION``` and ```_TBASIC.LUAFN```. Add the name of your word to ```_TBASIC._FNCTION```, and add a computer word to ```_TBASIC.LUAFN``` with your word name as a place-name. To make the computer *actually* understand your new *words*, is up to you.


## To make it understand your new sets of marks

Much the same as adding *word*s, but there's some different parts. You will add your *mark*s to ```_TBASIC._OPERATR``` and ```opprecedence```. Watch that ```opprecedence``` is *ordered*, and you should know the order of your new *mark*s â€” which mark comes before yours and which comes after. Think hard that order and add your *mark* to its right place. If it's the "right-to-left" thing, also add yours to ```opassoc.rtl```.


## Just tell me how to do that!

Let's say you want to add a word ``````UPGOER``````. What it does is it takes a number, and say *Up-goer ```number``` goes up!* If you tell computer ```UPGOER 5```, the computer will reply ```Up-goer 5 goes up!```

Here's how it's done:

0. Open ```TBASEXTN.lua```.
1. Enter this:
        
        local function _fnupgoer(n)
            print("Up-goer "..__checknumber(n).." goes up!")
        end
        
   at the bottom.
        
2. Add ```"UPGOER"``` to ```_TBASIC._FNCTION``` (enter this: ```table.insert(_TBASIC._FNCTION, "UPGOER")``` to the next line)
3. Add  ```{_fnupgoer, 1}``` to ```_TBASIC.LUAFN.UPGOER```. Meaning of the word ```UPGOER``` should be obvious, number ```1``` means that it will take that number of things to do something. (enter this: ```_TBASIC.LUAFN.UPGOER = {_fnupgoer, 1}``` to the next line)
4. Done!


## Tell me more!

* ```__checknumber(number)``` returns real number ```number``` if it can be written as a number. If not, computer will stop and say it didn't get a number.

* ```__checkstring(letters)``` returns letters ```letters``` if it can be written as letters.

* ```__assert(thing, type)``` will check the type of ```thing``` is a ```type```. If it is, computer will move on. If not, it will stop and say something.

* ```__readvar(varname)``` will
