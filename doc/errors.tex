This chapter describes errors defined in TBASIC.

\section{Error Description}

\subsection{SYNTAX} error denotes that TBASIC could not recognize the statement you have entered. Caused by things like missing parenthesis, illegal characters, incorrect punctuation, misspelled keyword, etc.

\subsection{<TYPE> EXPECTED, GOT <OTHERTYPE>} error denotes that the statement expected certain type(s) as one of its argument, but got unsupported other type.

\subsection{RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB} error denotes that RETURN statement is met, but GOSUB was not used before (or used up), and TBASIC does not know where to return.

\subsection{NEXT WITHOUT FOR} error denotes that NEXT statement is met, but FOR was not used, and TBASIC does not know where to return.

\subsection{ASSIGNMENT ON IF CLAUSE} error denotes that you have put assignment between IF and THEN. Usually caused by mistakenly typing \code{=} instead of \code{==}.
