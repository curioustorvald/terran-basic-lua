\section{Variable}

Variable is a symbolic name that refers to certain value. Variable is like a jar with name on it: you can put (\emph{assign} is a proper term) new value to the jar, look inside of the jar, or even empty one.

\subsection{Naming a Variable}

Name of the variable should be easily understandable and concise. It is strongly discouraged to name a variable with only one or two letters. (e.g. \code{I}, \code{A1})

TBASIC is somewhat pedantic about the variable name: you are only allowed to use \textbf{alphabets, numbers and underscores}, and \textbf{the name cannot start with a number}. For example, \code{USER_INPUT3} is valid but \code{3INPUT} is not. In some version or implementation of the TBASIC, those bad names would actually work for some extent, but it \emph{will} break some other parts, so don't use illegal names.
