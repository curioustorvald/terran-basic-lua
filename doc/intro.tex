\emph{Terran BASIC} (\emph{TBASIC} afterwards) is an BASIC language heavily influenced by the Commodore Basic version 2 (the one used in the legendary \emph{Commodore 64}), meant to be used with (but not necessarily) Lua to provide \emph{retro} feeling for any virtual computers that run upon it, targeted especially the OpenComputers and ComputerCraft for Minecraft. BASIC is an non-structured\footnote{prone to, and really good at, making spaghetties}, general-purpose\footnote{does whatever computers do}, high-level\footnote{at least the codes are written using ordinary letters, instead of 0s and 1s} programming language which is meant to be easy to use.
